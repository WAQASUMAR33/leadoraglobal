# Multiple Withdrawal Requests Feature

## Date: October 7, 2025

## Feature Update

**Enabled users to submit multiple withdrawal requests without waiting for previous requests to be approved.**

## Changes Made

### **Before** ❌
```javascript
// Users could only have ONE pending withdrawal request at a time
const pendingWithdrawal = await prisma.withdrawalRequest.findFirst({
  where: {
    userId: decoded.userId,
    status: 'pending'
  }
});

if (pendingWithdrawal) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: 'You already have a pending withdrawal request. Please wait for it to be processed.'
  }, { status: 400 });
}
```

**Limitation:**
- ❌ User had to wait for admin to approve/reject first request
- ❌ Could not withdraw in batches
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ Restricted flexibility

### **After** ✅
```javascript
// Allow multiple pending withdrawal requests
// (Removed restriction - users can now submit multiple requests)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Users can submit multiple withdrawal requests
- ✅ Better cash flow management
- ✅ Withdraw in batches
- ✅ Improved user experience
- ✅ More flexibility

## Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: Batch Withdrawals**
```
User has PKR 50,000 balance

Request 1: PKR 10,000 → Pending (Balance: 40,000)
Request 2: PKR 15,000 → Pending (Balance: 25,000)
Request 3: PKR 10,000 → Pending (Balance: 15,000)

All three requests can be submitted immediately!
Admin can then approve them one by one or in batch.
```

### **Scenario 2: Different Payment Methods**
```
User wants to split withdrawals to different accounts:

Request 1: PKR 20,000 → Bank Account A
Request 2: PKR 15,000 → JazzCash
Request 3: PKR 10,000 → EasyPaisa

All submitted at once, processed separately.
```

### **Scenario 3: Risk Management**
```
User wants to test system with small amount first:

Request 1: PKR 1,000 → Test withdrawal
(After confirmation)
Request 2: PKR 25,000 → Main withdrawal
Request 3: PKR 15,000 → Additional withdrawal

Can submit without waiting!
```

## How It Works

### **Balance Deduction**
```
Initial Balance: PKR 50,000

Withdrawal Request 1: PKR 10,000
├─> Balance deducted immediately: 50,000 - 10,000 = 40,000
└─> Status: Pending

Withdrawal Request 2: PKR 15,000
├─> Balance deducted immediately: 40,000 - 15,000 = 25,000
└─> Status: Pending

Withdrawal Request 3: PKR 10,000
├─> Balance deducted immediately: 25,000 - 10,000 = 15,000
└─> Status: Pending

Final Balance: PKR 15,000
Total Locked: PKR 35,000 (across 3 pending requests)
```

### **Approval Process**
```
Admin can approve requests in any order:

Approve Request 2:
├─> Fee: 15,000 × 10% = 1,500
├─> Net: 15,000 - 1,500 = 13,500
└─> Status: Approved (User receives PKR 13,500)

Reject Request 1:
├─> Refund: PKR 10,000
├─> Balance: 15,000 + 10,000 = 25,000
└─> Status: Rejected

Approve Request 3:
├─> Fee: 10,000 × 10% = 1,000
├─> Net: 10,000 - 1,000 = 9,000
└─> Status: Approved (User receives PKR 9,000)

Final State:
✅ Request 1: Rejected (Refunded)
✅ Request 2: Approved (Received PKR 13,500)
✅ Request 3: Approved (Received PKR 9,000)
Final Balance: PKR 25,000
```

## Validation & Safety

### **Balance Protection** ✅
```javascript
// Balance is deducted IMMEDIATELY when request is submitted
// This prevents over-withdrawal scenarios

Example:
Balance: PKR 30,000

Request 1: PKR 25,000 → OK (Balance: 5,000)
Request 2: PKR 10,000 → REJECTED (Insufficient balance)

Result: User can't withdraw more than they have!
```

### **Transaction Safety** ✅
```javascript
// Each request uses database transaction
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Deduct balance
  // 2. Create request
  // Either both succeed or both fail
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Atomic operations
- ✅ No race conditions
- ✅ Data consistency
- ✅ Rollback on error

### **Concurrent Request Handling** ✅
```
If two requests submitted simultaneously:

Request A: PKR 20,000
Request B: PKR 15,000
Balance: PKR 30,000

Database transaction ensures:
├─> Request A processed first: Balance 30,000 → 10,000
└─> Request B processed next: Balance 10,000 (insufficient)

One succeeds, one fails gracefully!
```

## UI Updates

## Technical Details

### **File Modified**
- `src/app/api/user/withdrawals/route.js`

### **Code Change**
```diff
- // Check if user has any pending withdrawal requests

-     status: 'pending'
-   }
- });
-

```

### **Validation Still In Place**
1. ✅ Minimum withdrawal: PKR 1,000
2. ✅ Minimum balance: PKR 1,000
3. ✅ Sufficient balance check
4. ✅ Valid payment method required
5. ✅ Transaction-based safety

## Examples

### **Example 1: Multiple Small Withdrawals**
```
User Balance: PKR 100,000

Day 1:
- Request 1: PKR 10,000 → Pending
- Request 2: PKR 15,000 → Pending
- Request 3: PKR 5,000 → Pending
Balance: PKR 70,000

Day 2:
Admin approves all:
- Request 1: Approved (User gets PKR 9,000)
- Request 2: Approved (User gets PKR 13,500)
- Request 3: Approved (User gets PKR 4,500)

Total Received: PKR 27,000
Total Fees: PKR 3,000
Remaining Balance: PKR 70,000
```

### **Example 2: Mixed Outcomes**
```
User Balance: PKR 50,000

Requests:
- Request 1: PKR 20,000 → Pending
- Request 2: PKR 15,000 → Pending
- Request 3: PKR 10,000 → Pending
Balance: PKR 5,000

Admin Actions:
- Request 1: Approved → User gets PKR 18,000
- Request 2: Rejected → Refunded PKR 15,000
- Request 3: Approved → User gets PKR 9,000

Final Balance: PKR 20,000 (5,000 + 15,000 refund)
Total Received: PKR 27,000
```

### **Example 3: Insufficient Balance**
```
User Balance: PKR 20,000

Request 1: PKR 15,000 → ✅ OK (Balance: 5,000)
Request 2: PKR 10,000 → ❌ FAIL (Insufficient balance)

Result: Only first request created
User sees error: "Insufficient balance for withdrawal"
```
