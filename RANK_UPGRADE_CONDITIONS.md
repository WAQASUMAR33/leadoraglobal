# 🏆 Rank Upgrade Conditions & Logic

## 📊 Current Rank Conditions (From Database)

| Rank ID | Rank Name | Required Points | Active Users | Description |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Consultant** | 0 | 1,121 | Default rank for new users |
| 2 | **Manager** | 1,000 | 333 | First promotion level |
| 3 | **Sapphire Manager** | 2,000 | 590 | Second promotion level |
| 4 | **Diamond** | 8,000 | 154 | Third promotion level |
| 5 | **Sapphire Diamond** | 24,000 | 58 | Highest promotion level |

*Note: Other ranks (Ambassador, etc.) exist but have 0 users currently*

## 🎯 **PRIMARY UPGRADE CONDITION**

### **Single Condition for Rank Upgrade:**
```javascript
user.points >= rank.required_points
```

**That's it!** There is **ONLY ONE CONDITION** for rank upgrade:
- **User's total points must be greater than or equal to the rank's required points**

---

## 🔧 **Exact Upgrade Logic**

### **1. Rank Calculation Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Get user's current points
const user = await getUserPoints(userId);

// Step 2: Read all ranks from database (ordered by required_points DESC)
const ranks = await prisma.rank.findMany({
  orderBy: { required_points: 'desc' }
});

// Step 3: Find highest rank user qualifies for
let newRankName = 'Consultant'; // Default fallback
let newRankId = null;

for (const rank of ranks) {
  if (user.points >= rank.required_points) {  // ← ONLY CONDITION
    newRankName = rank.title;
    newRankId = rank.id;
    break; // Take first (highest) qualifying rank
  }
}

// Step 4: Update user's rank if changed
if (currentRank !== newRankName) {
  await updateUserRank(userId, newRankId);
}
```

### **2. Rank Selection Logic:**
- **Greedy Selection**: Always selects the **highest qualifying rank**
- **No Downline Requirements**: Points are the **ONLY factor**
- **No Additional Conditions**: No team building, no sales requirements, etc.

## 📈 **Upgrade Examples**

| User Points | Current Rank | Upgrades To | When |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|------|
| 0 - 999 | Consultant | Consultant | Always |
| 1,000 - 1,999 | Consultant | Manager | At 1,000 points |
| 2,000 - 7,999 | Manager | Sapphire Manager | At 2,000 points |
| 8,000 - 23,999 | Sapphire Manager | Diamond | At 8,000 points |
| 24,000+ | Diamond | Sapphire Diamond | At 24,000 points |

## 🚀 **When Ranks Are Upgraded**

### **Trigger: Package Request Approval**
Ranks are upgraded **automatically** when:

1. **Package Request is Approved**
   - User purchases a package
   - Admin approves the request
   - Points are distributed to referral tree
   - All affected users get rank updates

2. **Points Distribution Process:**
   ```
   Package Buyer: +Package Points
   ├─ Direct Referrer: +Package Points  
   ├─ Level 2 Referrer: +Package Points
   ├─ Level 3 Referrer: +Package Points
   └─ ... continues up the tree
   ```

3. **Rank Update Triggers:**
   - After package buyer gets points
   - After direct commission calculation
   - After indirect commission calculation  
   - After points distribution to tree
   - Final batch update for all users

---

## ✅ **Validation Rules**

### **A. Points Validation:**
- `user.points >= 0` (must be non-negative)
- `user.points` must be a number
- Points are cumulative (never decrease)

### **B. Rank Validation:**
- Rank must exist in database
- User must qualify: `points >= required_points`
- Only highest qualifying rank is selected
- Rank update only if actually changed

### **C. Database Validation:**
- All operations in database transaction
- Rollback on any failure
- 120-second timeout for complex operations
- Detailed logging for debugging

## 💡 **Key Points**

### **✅ What IS Required:**
- **Points only** - No other conditions
- **Automatic processing** - No manual intervention
- **Database-driven** - Uses actual rank conditions from DB
- **Transaction-safe** - All operations in database transaction

### **❌ What is NOT Required:**
- No downline requirements
- No team building conditions
- No sales targets
- No time-based conditions
- No manual approval for rank upgrades

### **🎯 Summary:**
**The rank upgrade system is extremely simple:**
1. User accumulates points
2. When points reach a threshold, rank upgrades automatically
3. Only condition: `points >= required_points`
4. No other requirements or conditions exist
