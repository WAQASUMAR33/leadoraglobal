## Key Insights

### **1. Diamond Rank is Now Exclusive**

Impact: Diamond now means real leadership
```

### **2. Higher Ranks are Truly Elite**
```
Sapphire Diamond: 8 users (0.3% of system)
Ambassador: 2 users (0.08% of system)

```
92.7% of users unchanged

Or didn't have downlines to qualify for higher
```

---

## Processing Method

### **Bottom to Top Approach:**

```
1. Calculate depth for each user
2. Sort by depth (deepest first)
3. Update from bottom to top

Example Order:
  Level 11 users → Level 10 → Level 9 → ... → Level 1 → Level 0

Why? Ensures downline ranks are updated before upline checks
```
