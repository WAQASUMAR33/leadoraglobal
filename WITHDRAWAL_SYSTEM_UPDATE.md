# Withdrawal System Update - Balance Deduction & Refund Logic

## Date: October 7, 2025

## Overview

Updated the withdrawal system to implement proper balance management:
1. **Immediate Balance Deduction** - When user submits withdrawal request
2. **Fee Calculation on Approval** - Admin approval calculates 10% fee and 90% net payout
3. **Automatic Refund on Rejection** - Full amount refunded when admin rejects

## Changes Implemented

### 1. User Withdrawal Request (User Side)

**File**: `src/app/api/user/withdrawals/route.js`

#### **Before** ❌
```javascript
// Balance was NOT deducted when user submitted request
// Balance deduction happened only when admin approved
```

#### **After** ✅
```javascript
// Balance is deducted IMMEDIATELY when user submits request
// Uses transaction to ensure atomicity

const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Deduct the full withdrawal amount from user's balance
  const updatedUser = await tx.user.update({
    where: { id: decoded.userId },
    data: {
      balance: {
        decrement: withdrawalAmount
      }
    }
  });

  // Create withdrawal request
  const withdrawal = await tx.withdrawalRequest.create({
    data: {
      userId: decoded.userId,
      amount: withdrawalAmount,
      feeAmount: 0, // Fee calculated on approval
      netAmount: withdrawalAmount,
      paymentMethod: paymentMethod.type,
      // ... other fields
      status: 'pending',
      withdrawalRef
    }
  });

  return { withdrawal, updatedUser };
});
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Deducts 100% of withdrawal amount immediately
- ✅ Uses database transaction for atomicity
- ✅ Returns updated balance to user
- ✅ Shows clear message: "Amount has been deducted from your balance"

### 2. Admin Approval Logic (Admin Side)

**File**: `src/app/api/admin/withdrawals/[id]/route.js`

#### **Approval Process** ✅

```javascript
if (status === 'approved' && existingWithdrawal.status !== 'approved') {
  const totalAmount = parseFloat(existingWithdrawal.amount);
  const feeAmount = totalAmount * 0.1; // 10% fee
  const netAmount = totalAmount - feeAmount; // 90% net payout
  
  // Update withdrawal request with fee details
  updateData.feeAmount = feeAmount;
  updateData.netAmount = netAmount;
  
  // NOTE: Balance already deducted when user submitted request
  // Admin just processes the payout of netAmount (90%)
}
```

**What Happens:**
- ✅ Calculates 10% fee
- ✅ Calculates 90% net payout amount
- ✅ NO balance deduction (already done)
- ✅ Admin processes payout of 90% to user's account

#### **Rejection Process** ✅

```javascript
if (status === 'rejected' && existingWithdrawal.status !== 'rejected') {
  const refundAmount = parseFloat(existingWithdrawal.amount);
  const newBalance = parseFloat(existingWithdrawal.user.balance) + refundAmount;
  
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: existingWithdrawal.userId },
    data: { balance: newBalance }
  });
  
  console.log(`💰 Withdrawal Rejected - Refunded: ${refundAmount}`);
}
```

**What Happens:**
- ✅ Refunds 100% of withdrawal amount
- ✅ Adds amount back to user's balance
- ✅ Works regardless of previous status
- ✅ Logs refund action for audit trail

### 3. Admin Cancellation Logic

```javascript
// DELETE endpoint - Cancel withdrawal request
if (existingWithdrawal.status !== 'rejected' && existingWithdrawal.status !== 'approved') {
  const refundAmount = parseFloat(existingWithdrawal.amount);
  const newBalance = parseFloat(existingWithdrawal.user.balance) + refundAmount;
  
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: existingWithdrawal.userId },
    data: { balance: newBalance }
  });
}
```

**What Happens:**
- ✅ Refunds amount if status is pending
- ✅ No refund if already approved (money sent)
- ✅ No refund if already rejected (already refunded)

## Complete Withdrawal Flow

### **Scenario 1: Successful Withdrawal** ✅

```
1. User submits withdrawal request (PKR 10,000)
   └─> User Balance: 15,000 → 5,000 (deducted immediately)
   └─> Request Status: pending
   └─> Fee: 0 (calculated later)
   └─> Net: 10,000

2. Admin approves request
   └─> Fee Calculation: 10,000 * 10% = 1,000
   └─> Net Payout: 10,000 - 1,000 = 9,000
   └─> User Balance: 5,000 (unchanged)
   └─> Request Status: approved
   └─> Admin pays PKR 9,000 to user's bank account

3. Final Result:
   ✅ User received: PKR 9,000 (90%)
   ✅ Platform fee: PKR 1,000 (10%)
   ✅ User balance: PKR 5,000
```

### **Scenario 2: Rejected Withdrawal** ✅

```
1. User submits withdrawal request (PKR 10,000)
   └─> User Balance: 15,000 → 5,000 (deducted immediately)
   └─> Request Status: pending

2. Admin rejects request
   └─> Refund: PKR 10,000 added back to balance
   └─> User Balance: 5,000 → 15,000 (refunded)
   └─> Request Status: rejected

3. Final Result:
   ✅ User received: PKR 0
   ✅ Platform fee: PKR 0
   ✅ User balance: PKR 15,000 (fully refunded)
```

### **Scenario 3: Cancelled Request** ✅

```
1. User submits withdrawal request (PKR 10,000)
   └─> User Balance: 15,000 → 5,000 (deducted immediately)
   └─> Request Status: pending

2. Admin cancels request (DELETE)
   └─> Refund: PKR 10,000 added back to balance
   └─> User Balance: 5,000 → 15,000 (refunded)
   └─> Request Status: rejected

3. Final Result:
   ✅ User received: PKR 0
   ✅ Platform fee: PKR 0
   ✅ User balance: PKR 15,000 (fully refunded)
```

## Balance Calculations

### **Example 1: PKR 10,000 Withdrawal**

| Stage | User Balance | Fee | Net Payout | Status |
|-------|--------------|-----|------------|--------|
| **Before Request** | 15,000 | - | - | - |
| **After Request (Pending)** | 5,000 | 0 | - | pending |
| **After Approval** | 5,000 | 1,000 | 9,000 | approved |
| **Admin Pays User** | 5,000 | 1,000 | 9,000 | completed |

### **Example 2: PKR 50,000 Withdrawal**

| Stage | User Balance | Fee | Net Payout | Status |
|-------|--------------|-----|------------|--------|
| **Before Request** | 80,000 | - | - | - |
| **After Request (Pending)** | 30,000 | 0 | - | pending |
| **After Approval** | 30,000 | 5,000 | 45,000 | approved |
| **Admin Pays User** | 30,000 | 5,000 | 45,000 | completed |

### **Example 3: Rejected Withdrawal**

| Stage | User Balance | Fee | Net Payout | Status |
|-------|--------------|-----|------------|--------|
| **Before Request** | 20,000 | - | - | - |
| **After Request (Pending)** | 10,000 | 0 | - | pending |
| **After Rejection** | 20,000 | 0 | 0 | rejected |

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Database Transaction Usage**

```javascript
// Ensures atomicity - either both operations succeed or both fail
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Deduct balance
  await tx.user.update({ ... });
  
  // 2. Create withdrawal request
  await tx.withdrawalRequest.create({ ... });
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Atomic operations (all or nothing)
- ✅ Prevents race conditions
- ✅ Ensures data consistency
- ✅ Rollback on error

### **Validation Checks**

**User Side (Before Request):**
1. ✅ Minimum withdrawal: PKR 1,000
2. ✅ Minimum balance: PKR 1,000
3. ✅ Sufficient balance for withdrawal
4. ✅ No pending withdrawal requests
5. ✅ Valid payment method

**Admin Side (Before Approval):**
1. ✅ Withdrawal exists
2. ✅ Not already processed
3. ✅ Valid status transition

### **Security Features**

1. **JWT Token Verification** - User authentication
2. **Admin Token Verification** - Admin authorization
3. **Database Transactions** - Data integrity
4. **Status Validation** - Prevents duplicate processing
5. **Balance Validation** - Prevents negative balances
6. **Audit Logging** - Console logs for tracking

## Fee Structure

```
Withdrawal Amount: X
Platform Fee: X * 10% = Fee
Net Payout: X * 90% = X - Fee

Example:
- PKR 10,000 withdrawal
- Fee: PKR 1,000 (10%)
- User receives: PKR 9,000 (90%)
```

## Status Flow

```
[User Submits]
      ↓
   PENDING (Balance deducted)
      ↓
      ├─→ [Admin Approves] → APPROVED (Fee calculated, net payout processed)
      │
      └─→ [Admin Rejects] → REJECTED (Full amount refunded)
```

- ✅ Immediate balance deduction on request
- ✅ Proper fee calculation on approval (10% fee, 90% net)
- ✅ Automatic refunds on rejection
