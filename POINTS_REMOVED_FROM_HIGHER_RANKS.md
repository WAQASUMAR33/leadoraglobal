## User Journey Impact

### **Before:**

```
User builds team:
  → Has 10 Diamond referrals
  → But only 40,000 points
  → Cannot reach Ambassador (needs 50,000 points)
  → Must buy more packages to get points
  → Frustrating for good leaders
```

### **After:**

```
User builds team:
  → Has 10 Diamond referrals
  → Has 40,000 points (doesn't matter)
  → Qualifies for Ambassador! ✅
  → Rewarded for team building
  → Happy leader
```

---

## Rank Check Logic Now

### **For Diamond:**
```javascript
if (user.points < 8000) {
  return { qualifies: false };  // Points still matter
}

// Check downline
if (qualifyingLines >= 3) {
  return { qualifies: true };
}
```

### **For Ranks Above Diamond:**
```javascript
// NO points check - removed!

// Only check downline
if (qualifyingLines >= required) {
  return { qualifies: true };
}
```
