# Shopping Amount Restriction Implementation

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Overview

Implemented shopping amount restrictions to prevent users with active packages from adding products to cart that exceed their available shopping amount.

---

## Problem

Users with active packages could add unlimited products to their cart, exceeding their package's shopping amount limit. This caused issues during checkout when the system would reject orders that exceeded the limit.

**Previous Behavior:**
- ❌ Users could add any amount of products to cart
- ❌ Restriction only checked at checkout
- ❌ Poor user experience (finding out at checkout)
- ❌ Wasted time selecting products they couldn't buy

---

## Solution

Added **real-time shopping amount validation** when:
1. Adding products to cart (Shop page)
2. Updating product quantities (Cart page)

**New Behavior:**
- ✅ Check available shopping amount before adding to cart
- ✅ Show clear error message if limit would be exceeded
- ✅ Display remaining available amount
- ✅ Prevent cart updates that exceed limit
- ✅ Better user experience with immediate feedback

---

## How It Works

### **Shopping Amount Types**

#### **1. Users with Active Package (Package Benefits)**
```javascript
shoppingType: 'package_benefits'
```
**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Has `currentPackageId`
- ✅ Package not expired
- ✅ Paid via bank transfer/JazzCash (has shopping amount)
- ✅ Shopping amount limit applies

**Example:**
```
User: Ahmed
Package: Pro Max
Package Amount: PKR 50,000
Shopping Amount: PKR 20,000
Already Spent: PKR 5,000
Remaining: PKR 15,000 ✅ LIMIT ENFORCED
```

#### **2. Users with Package (Paid from Balance)**
```javascript
shoppingType: 'payment_proof_required'
effectiveShoppingAmount: 0
```
**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Has `currentPackageId`
- ✅ Package not expired
- ✅ Paid from balance (no shopping amount)
- ❌ No shopping amount limit (can shop unlimited with payment proof)

**Example:**
```
User: Sara
Package: Pro Max
Paid: From balance
Shopping Amount: 0
Can Shop: Unlimited ✅ NO LIMIT
```

#### **3. Users without Active Package**
```javascript
shoppingType: 'payment_proof_required'
remainingAmount: null
```
**Characteristics:**
- ❌ No `currentPackageId` or package expired
- ❌ No shopping amount limit
- ✅ Can shop unlimited with payment proof

**Example:**
```
User: Ali
Package: None
Can Shop: Unlimited ✅ NO LIMIT
Payment: Must upload proof at checkout
```

---

## Implementation Details

### **Shop Page (`src/app/user-dashboard/shop/page.js`)**

#### **Changes Made:**

**1. Added Shopping Eligibility Check in `addToCart` Function**

```javascript
const addToCart = (product) => {
  try {
    // Check if user has active package with shopping amount limit
    if (shoppingEligibility && 
        shoppingEligibility.shopping && 
        shoppingEligibility.shopping.shoppingType === 'package_benefits' &&
        shoppingEligibility.shopping.remainingAmount !== null) {
      
      // Calculate current cart total
      const currentCartTotal = getCartTotal();
      
      // Calculate new cart total if we add this product
      const productPrice = parseFloat(product.sale_price || product.price);
      const newCartTotal = currentCartTotal + productPrice;
      const remainingAmount = shoppingEligibility.shopping.remainingAmount;
      
      // Check if new cart total exceeds available shopping amount
      if (newCartTotal > remainingAmount) {
        const maxCanAdd = Math.max(0, remainingAmount - currentCartTotal);
        alert(
          `Shopping amount limit reached!\n\n` +
          `Available shopping amount: PKR ${remainingAmount.toFixed(2)}\n` +
          `Current cart total: PKR ${currentCartTotal.toFixed(2)}\n` +
          `You can add products worth: PKR ${maxCanAdd.toFixed(2)}\n\n` +
          `This product costs: PKR ${productPrice.toFixed(2)}`
        );
        return; // PREVENT ADDING TO CART
      }
    }

    // Proceed with adding to cart (if check passed or no limit)
    // ... existing cart logic ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding to cart:', error);
  }
};
```

**Logic:**
1. ✅ Check if user has package with shopping benefits
2. ✅ Calculate current cart total
3. ✅ Calculate what new total would be with this product
4. ✅ Compare with remaining shopping amount
5. ✅ If exceeds → Show alert and prevent adding
6. ✅ If within limit → Add to cart normally

---

### **Cart Page (`src/app/user-dashboard/cart/page.js`)**

#### **Changes Made:**

**1. Added State for Shopping Eligibility**

```javascript
const [shoppingEligibility, setShoppingEligibility] = useState(null);
```

**2. Fetch Shopping Eligibility on Load**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Load cart from localStorage
  const savedCart = localStorage.getItem('cart');
  if (savedCart) {
    setCart(JSON.parse(savedCart));
  }
  
  // Fetch shopping eligibility
  fetchShoppingEligibility();
  
  setLoading(false);
}, []);

const fetchShoppingEligibility = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user/shopping-eligibility', {
      credentials: 'include'
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      setShoppingEligibility(data);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching shopping eligibility:', error);
  }
};
```

**3. Updated `updateQuantity` Function**

```javascript
const updateQuantity = (productId, newQuantity) => {
  if (newQuantity <= 0) {
    removeFromCart(productId);
    return;
  }

  // Check if user has shopping amount limit
  if (shoppingEligibility && 
      shoppingEligibility.shopping && 
      shoppingEligibility.shopping.shoppingType === 'package_benefits' &&
      shoppingEligibility.shopping.remainingAmount !== null) {
    
    // Calculate what the new cart total would be
    const newCart = cart.map(item =>
      item.id === productId
        ? { ...item, quantity: newQuantity }
        : item
    );
    
    const newCartTotal = newCart.reduce((total, item) => {
      const price = parseFloat(item.sale_price || item.price);
      return total + (price * item.quantity);
    }, 0);
    
    const remainingAmount = shoppingEligibility.shopping.remainingAmount;
    
    // Check if new total exceeds available shopping amount
    if (newCartTotal > remainingAmount) {
      alert(
        `Shopping amount limit reached!\n\n` +
        `Available shopping amount: PKR ${remainingAmount.toFixed(2)}\n` +
        `New cart total would be: PKR ${newCartTotal.toFixed(2)}\n\n` +
        `Please reduce the quantity or remove items from cart.`
      );
      return; // PREVENT QUANTITY UPDATE
    }
  }

  // Proceed with update (if check passed or no limit)
  const updatedCart = cart.map(item =>
    item.id === productId
      ? { ...item, quantity: newQuantity }
      : item
  );
  setCart(updatedCart);
  localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(updatedCart));
};
```

**Logic:**
1. ✅ Check if user has package with shopping benefits
2. ✅ Calculate what new cart total would be with updated quantity
3. ✅ Compare with remaining shopping amount
4. ✅ If exceeds → Show alert and prevent update
5. ✅ If within limit → Update quantity normally

## Examples

### **Example 1: Adding Product - Within Limit** ✅

```
User: Ahmed
Package: Pro Max
Shopping Amount: PKR 20,000
Already Spent: PKR 5,000

  Remaining = PKR 15,000
  
  PKR 13,000 <= PKR 15,000 ✅

Action: Product added to cart
Result: Cart total now PKR 13,000
```

  - Product B: PKR 3,000 × 1 = PKR 3,000
  Total: PKR 7,000

User tries to increase Product B quantity to 3:
  New Total = (PKR 2,000 × 2) + (PKR 3,000 × 3) = PKR 13,000
  Remaining = PKR 8,000
  
  PKR 13,000 > PKR 8,000 ❌

Alert Shown:
  Shopping amount limit reached!

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before Implementation** ❌

```
User Journey:
1. Browse products
2. Add PKR 30,000 worth of products to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Checkout fails: "Exceeds shopping amount (PKR 20,000)"
5. User frustrated - has to go back and remove items
6. Poor experience
```

### **After Implementation** ✅

```
User Journey:
1. Browse products
2. Add products to cart (PKR 18,000)
3. Try to add PKR 5,000 product
4. Alert: "Shopping amount limit reached! You can add PKR 2,000 more"
5. User knows limit immediately
6. User adjusts selection accordingly
7. Smooth checkout experience
```

## Alert Messages

### **Shop Page Alert (Add to Cart)**

```
Shopping amount limit reached!

Available shopping amount: PKR 15,000.00
Current cart total: PKR 12,000.00
You can add products worth: PKR 3,000.00

This product costs: PKR 5,000.00
```

**Information Provided:**
- ✅ Total available shopping amount
- ✅ Current cart total
- ✅ How much more they can add
- ✅ Price of the product they tried to add

### **Cart Page Alert (Update Quantity)**

```
Shopping amount limit reached!

Available shopping amount: PKR 8,000.00
New cart total would be: PKR 13,000.00

Please reduce the quantity or remove items from cart.
```

**Information Provided:**
- ✅ Total available shopping amount
- ✅ What the new total would be

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### **1. No Shopping Eligibility Data**
```javascript
if (!shoppingEligibility) {
  // Allow shopping (fail open for better UX)
  // User will be checked at checkout
}
```

### **2. Users Without Package**
```javascript
if (shoppingEligibility.shopping.remainingAmount === null) {
  // No limit - allow unlimited shopping
  // They'll need payment proof at checkout
}
```

### **3. Users with Package from Balance**
```javascript
if (shoppingEligibility.shopping.shoppingType === 'payment_proof_required') {
  // No limit even if they have package
  // Package paid from balance = no shopping amount
}
```

### **4. Decimal Amounts**
```javascript
// All calculations use parseFloat and .toFixed(2)
const price = parseFloat(product.sale_price || product.price);
alert(`PKR ${remainingAmount.toFixed(2)}`); // Shows 2 decimal places
```

### **5. Multiple Items in Cart**
```javascript
// Correctly calculates total across all cart items
const currentCartTotal = cart.reduce((total, item) => {
  const price = parseFloat(item.sale_price || item.price);
  return total + (price * item.quantity);
}, 0);
```
