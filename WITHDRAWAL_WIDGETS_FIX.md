# Withdrawal Widgets Data Fix

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Issue

User dashboard withdrawal widgets were not showing data:
- **Approved Withdrawals**: Widget showing PKR 0
- **Withdrawal Requests**: Count not available

## Root Cause

The dashboard API endpoint (`/api/user/dashboard`) was only providing `pendingWithdrawals` in the stats object, but the frontend was also expecting:
- `approvedWithdrawals` - Total approved withdrawal amount
- `totalWithdrawalRequests` - Number of withdrawal requests

## Solution

Updated the dashboard API to include complete withdrawal statistics.

---

## Changes Made

### **File: `src/app/api/user/dashboard/route.js`**

#### **Added Approved Withdrawals Calculation:**

```javascript
// Get approved withdrawal amount
const approvedWithdrawals = await prisma.withdrawalRequest.aggregate({
  where: {
    userId: parseInt(userId),
    status: 'approved'
  },
  _sum: {
    netAmount: true  // Use netAmount (amount after 10% fee deduction)
  }
});
```

**Why `netAmount`?**
- When a withdrawal is approved, the user receives the net amount (90% of requested amount)
- The 10% fee is deducted
- We show the actual amount user received

#### **Added Total Withdrawal Requests Count:**

```javascript
// Get total withdrawal requests count
const totalWithdrawalRequests = await prisma.withdrawalRequest.count({
  where: {
    userId: parseInt(userId)
  }
});
```

**Counts all withdrawal requests:**
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected

#### **Updated Stats Object:**

```javascript
stats: {
  balance: parseFloat(user.balance || 0),
  points: user.points || 0,
  totalEarnings: parseFloat(user.totalEarnings || 0),
  directEarnings: parseFloat(directEarnings._sum.amount || 0),
  indirectEarnings: parseFloat(indirectEarnings._sum.amount || 0),
  referralCount: user.referralCount || 0,
  ordersCount: ordersCount,
  rank: user.rank,
  pendingWithdrawals: parseFloat(pendingWithdrawals._sum.amount || 0),
  approvedWithdrawals: parseFloat(approvedWithdrawals._sum.netAmount || 0),  // NEW
  totalWithdrawalRequests: totalWithdrawalRequests                           // NEW
}
```

## Frontend Display

### **User Dashboard Widgets**

#### **Widget 9: Approved Withdrawals**

**Location:** `src/app/user-dashboard/page.js` (Line 284-299)

```javascript
{/* 9. Approved Withdrawals */}
<div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 border border-gray-700">
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <div className="flex-shrink-0">
      <div className="w-8 h-8 bg-red-500 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
        <svg className="w-5 h-5 text-white" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
          <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M9 12l2 2 4-4m6 2a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z" />
        </svg>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="ml-4">
      <p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-400">Approved Withdrawals</p>
      <p className="text-lg font-bold text-white">{formatCurrency(stats.approvedWithdrawals || 0)}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Now Shows:**
- ‚úÖ Total amount of all approved withdrawals (net amount after fees)
- ‚úÖ Formatted as currency (PKR X,XXX)

#### **Widget 10: Withdrawal Pending**

**Location:** `src/app/user-dashboard/page.js` (Line 301-316)

```javascript
{/* 10. Withdrawal Pending */}
<div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 border border-gray-700">
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <div className="flex-shrink-0">
      <div className="w-8 h-8 bg-amber-500 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
        <svg className="w-5 h-5 text-white" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
          <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M12 8v4l3 3m6-3a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z" />
        </svg>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="ml-4">
      <p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-400">Withdrawal Pending</p>
      <p className="text-lg font-bold text-white">{formatCurrency(stats.pendingWithdrawals)}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Now Shows:**
- ‚úÖ Total amount of pending withdrawal requests
- ‚úÖ Formatted as currency (PKR X,XXX)

## Data Flow

### **API Response Structure**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": { ... },
    "stats": {
      "balance": 50000,
      "points": 15000,
      "totalEarnings": 75000,
      "directEarnings": 50000,
      "indirectEarnings": 25000,
      "referralCount": 15,
      "ordersCount": 8,
      "rank": { "id": 4, "title": "Diamond" },
      "pendingWithdrawals": 10000,
      "approvedWithdrawals": 45000,      // NEW - Total net amount approved
      "totalWithdrawalRequests": 12      // NEW - Total count of requests
    },
    "recentActivity": [ ... ],
    "inactiveMembersCount": 5,
    "potentialRevenue": 25000
  }
}
```

### **Frontend Usage**

```javascript
// User Dashboard Page
const { user: userData, stats, recentActivity } = dashboardData;

// Widget displays
<p>{formatCurrency(stats.approvedWithdrawals || 0)}</p>  // Shows approved amount
<p>{formatCurrency(stats.pendingWithdrawals)}</p>        // Shows pending amount
<p>{stats.totalWithdrawalRequests}</p>                    // Shows total count
```

## Database Queries

### **Query 1: Pending Withdrawals**

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) as _sum_amount
FROM withdrawal_requests
WHERE userId = ?
  AND status = 'pending'
```

### **Query 2: Approved Withdrawals**

```sql
SELECT SUM(netAmount) as _sum_netAmount
FROM withdrawal_requests
WHERE userId = ?
  AND status = 'approved'
```

**Why `netAmount`?**
- `amount`: Full requested amount (e.g., PKR 10,000)
- `netAmount`: Amount after 10% fee (e.g., PKR 9,000)
- Approved withdrawals show what user actually received

### **Query 3: Total Withdrawal Requests**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count
FROM withdrawal_requests
WHERE userId = ?
```

---

## Withdrawal Status Flow

### **Status Progression**

```
1. User submits withdrawal request
   ‚Üì
   Status: PENDING
   - Amount: PKR 10,000 (deducted from balance)
   - Net Amount: PKR 9,000 (calculated)
   - Fee: PKR 1,000 (10%)
   ‚Üì
2a. Admin APPROVES
    ‚Üì
    Status: APPROVED
    - User keeps the deduction
    - Shows in "Approved Withdrawals" widget
    ‚Üì
2b. Admin REJECTS
    ‚Üì
    Status: REJECTED
    - Amount refunded to user balance
    - Shows in total requests count
```

### **Widget Behavior**

**Pending Withdrawals Widget:**
```
Shows SUM of all requests with status = 'pending'
- User submits PKR 10,000 ‚Üí Widget shows PKR 10,000
- User submits another PKR 5,000 ‚Üí Widget shows PKR 15,000
- Admin approves PKR 10,000 ‚Üí Widget shows PKR 5,000
```

**Approved Withdrawals Widget:**
```
Shows SUM of netAmount for requests with status = 'approved'
- Admin approves PKR 10,000 request ‚Üí Widget shows PKR 9,000 (net)
- Admin approves PKR 5,000 request ‚Üí Widget shows PKR 13,500 (9,000 + 4,500)
```
