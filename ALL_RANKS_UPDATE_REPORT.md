## Update Summary

## Processing Method

### **Bottom to Top Approach:**

```
1. Calculate depth for each user (distance from root)
2. Sort users by depth (deepest first)
3. Update ranks starting from bottom
4. Ensures downline ranks are updated before checking upline
```

**Why this order?**
- Downline members' ranks affect upline qualification
- Must update children before parents
- Ensures accurate downline requirement checks
