# Zero Shopping Amount Package Fix

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Problem

User `waqasumar33` has an active Student package with shopping_amount = 0, but the system was still allowing unlimited shopping.

**Root Cause:**
The shopping eligibility API was treating all packages with `shoppingAmount === 0` as "paid from balance" and allowing unlimited shopping with payment proof.

**Issue:**
There are two different scenarios with 0 shopping amount:
1. ‚ùå Package inherently has 0 shopping amount (e.g., Student package) ‚Üí Should NOT allow shopping
2. ‚úÖ Package paid from user balance ‚Üí Should allow unlimited shopping with payment proof

The system was not distinguishing between these two cases.

---

## Solution

Updated the shopping eligibility logic to differentiate between three scenarios:

### **Scenario 1: Paid from Balance** ‚úÖ
- User paid for package using their balance
- Transaction ID starts with `BAL_`
- Transaction receipt = "Paid from user balance"
- **Result:** Unlimited shopping with payment proof

### **Scenario 2: Package with Shopping Amount** ‚úÖ
- Package has shopping_amount > 0
- User paid via bank/JazzCash
- **Result:** Shopping within limit

### **Scenario 3: Package with 0 Shopping Amount** ‚ùå
- Package inherently has shopping_amount = 0 (Student package)
- User paid via bank/JazzCash (not from balance)
- **Result:** NO shopping allowed

---

## Implementation

### **API Changes: `src/app/api/user/shopping-eligibility/route.js`**

#### **1. Added `paidFromBalance` Flag**

```javascript
let paidFromBalance = false;

if (hasActivePackage) {
  const recentPackageRequest = await prisma.packageRequest.findFirst({
    where: {
      userId: parseInt(userId),
      packageId: user.currentPackageId,
      status: 'approved'
    },
    orderBy: {
      updatedAt: 'desc'
    }
  });
  
  // Check if paid from balance
  if (recentPackageRequest && 
      recentPackageRequest.transactionId && 
      recentPackageRequest.transactionId.startsWith('BAL_') && 
      recentPackageRequest.transactionReceipt === 'Paid from user balance') {
    paidFromBalance = true;
  }
}
```

#### **2. Three-Scenario Logic**

```javascript
if (paidFromBalance) {
  // Scenario 1: Paid from balance - unlimited shopping
  return {
    eligible: true,
    shoppingType: 'payment_proof_required',
    remainingAmount: null
  };
  
} else if (effectiveShoppingAmount === 0) {
  // Scenario 3: Package with 0 shopping amount - NO shopping
  return {
    eligible: false,
    shoppingType: 'no_shopping_allowed',
    remainingAmount: 0
  };
  
} else {
  // Scenario 2: Package with shopping amount - shopping within limit
  return {
    eligible: true,
    shoppingType: 'package_benefits',
    remainingAmount: shoppingAmount - totalSpent
  };
}
```

---

### **Frontend Changes: `src/app/user-dashboard/shop/page.js`**

#### **1. Added Warning Card for Ineligible Users**

```javascript
{/* Warning for users with package but no shopping amount */}
{shoppingEligibility.shopping.shoppingType === 'no_shopping_allowed' && (
  <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-orange-900">
    <h3>Shopping Not Available</h3>
    <p>Your package does not include shopping benefits.</p>
    <Link href="/user-dashboard/my-package">
      Upgrade Your Package
    </Link>
  </div>
)}
```

#### **2. Updated Add to Cart Validation**

```javascript
const addToCart = (product) => {
  // First check: Is shopping allowed at all?
  if (shoppingEligibility && !shoppingEligibility.eligible) {
    alert('Shopping Not Available! Your package does not include shopping benefits.');
    return; // BLOCK ADDING TO CART
  }
  
  // Second check: Shopping amount limit (if applicable)
  if (shoppingType === 'package_benefits' && remainingAmount !== null) {
    // Check if exceeds limit...
  }
  
  // Proceed with adding to cart
  // ...
};
```
